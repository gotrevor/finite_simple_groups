# Subnormal subgroups — the missing primitive under `E(G)`

A subgroup `H` of `G` is **subnormal** when there is a finite chain
`H = H₀ ⊴ H₁ ⊴ ⋯ ⊴ Hₙ = G`, each term normal in the *next* (not necessarily in
`G`). This is strictly weaker than normality and is the relation the layer `E(G)`
is built on: a **component** of `G` is a subnormal *quasisimple* subgroup
(see `Quasisimple.lean`), and `E(G) = ⟨components⟩` (next brick).

mathlib (v4.29.1) has **no notion of subnormal subgroup** (`grep -ri subnormal`
finds only `subgroupOf`-flavoured names, nothing about chains). We supply it as the
reflexive-transitive closure of the one-step relation "`H ≤ K` with `H` normal in
`K`", reusing `Relation.ReflTransGen` so transitivity and induction come for free.

## Main definitions

* `IsNormalStep H K` — `H ≤ K` and `H` is normal in `K` (`(H.subgroupOf K).Normal`).
* `IsSubnormal H K` — `Relation.ReflTransGen IsNormalStep H K`: a finite ascending
  chain of normal steps from `H` up to `K`.

## Main results

* `IsSubnormal.refl`, `IsSubnormal.trans` — it is a preorder (reflexive, transitive).
* `IsNormalStep.isSubnormal` — a single normal step is subnormal.
* `IsSubnormal.le` — subnormal subgroups are contained in the ambient group.
* `Subgroup.Normal.isSubnormal_top` — a normal subgroup is subnormal in `G` (`⊤`).
