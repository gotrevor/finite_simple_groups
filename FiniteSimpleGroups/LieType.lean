# Family 3: Classical groups of Lie type

The largest of the families by count. Four infinite series, each parametrized
by a dimension `n` and a finite field `F_q` (where `q = p^k` for `p` prime):

| Series | Symbol | Construction | Simple when... |
|--------|--------|--------------|----------------|
| Type `A_{n-1}` (linear) | `PSL_n(q)` | `SL_n(F_q) / center` | `n ≥ 2`, except `(n,q) ∈ {(2,2),(2,3)}` |
| Type `²A_{n-1}` (unitary) | `PSU_n(q)` | `SU_n(F_{q²}) / center` | `n ≥ 3`, with small exceptions |
| Type `C_n` (symplectic) | `PSp_{2n}(q)` | `Sp_{2n}(F_q) / center` | `n ≥ 2`, except `(n,q) = (2,2)` |
| Type `B_n`/`D_n` (orthogonal) | `PΩ^ε_n(q)` | commutator subgroup of `O^ε_n(F_q) / center` | various conditions |

The exceptions arise because in very small cases the "group" collapses to
something already in another family (e.g., `PSL_2(2) ≅ S_3`, not simple;
`PSL_2(3) ≅ A_4`, also not simple; `PSL_2(4) ≅ PSL_2(5) ≅ A_5`).

**Why "Lie type":** These groups are the analogs of real/complex Lie groups
(`SL_n(R)`, etc.) defined over a finite field. The whole theory of root
systems, Weyl groups, and Dynkin diagrams transfers — which is why the
classification is so structured.

**Status in mathlib:** Partial. `SL_n` and `GL_n` are defined; the projective
quotients and the simplicity proofs are largely missing in v4.29.1. This file
states the simplicity claims as `sorry`.

**Reading:** Carter, *Simple Groups of Lie Type* (1972) — the standard
reference. Gorenstein-Lyons-Solomon Volume 1 § 2 for a CFSG-friendly
overview.
